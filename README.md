#### TIME SERIES FORCASTING ####
# Pros:
+ Superior accuracy in complex markets
+ Automatic feature learning
+ Handles multiple data types
+ Adapts to new patterns
+ State-of-the-art performance

# Cons:
- Black box (hard to interpret)
- Computationally expensive
- Requires large datasets
- Sensitive to hyperparameters
- Overfitting risk

- # Recommended Strategy:
1. Use ARIMA for quick analysis and baseline
2. Apply LSTM for refined, accurate predictions
3. Compare results for consensus
4. Use ARIMA confidence intervals for risk assessment
5. Deploy LSTM for final trading decisions

# Implementation:
if (ARIMA_trend == LSTM_trend) and (confidence > 80%):
    execute_trade()
else:
    wait_for_confirmation()
